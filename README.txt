Security:
---------
Ensure that the following HTTP security headers are configured on the server:

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

These headers should be configured in the web server configuration (e.g., .htaccess for Apache) or in a common PHP file included in all pages.

Regularly verify that these headers are correctly applied using browser developer tools or an online HTTP header checking service.

Important:
- Keep all dependencies and software versions up to date.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use HTTPS throughout the site.
- Implement CSRF protection for all forms.
- Properly escape all output to prevent XSS attacks.
